A point query is a database operation that finds the records that exactly match our query conditions. In this project, we perform point query on $1$-dimensional data and $2$ dimensional data. We assign the database records into pages, predict the page index with the index models and then perform sequential search on the predicted page. In order to evaluate the errors that different index models are making, we focus on predicting the page indices and ignore the sequential search operation on a specific page. 

\begin{mscexample}
For example, assume we have an $1$-dimensional array $[1,2,3,4]$ and two pages such that $[1,2]\in P_0$ and $[3,4]\in P_1$. A point query for $x=2$ is expected to return 0 as the page index.
