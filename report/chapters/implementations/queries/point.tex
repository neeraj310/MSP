A point query is a database operation that finds the records that exactly match our query conditions. In this project, we perform point query on $1$-dimensional data and $2$ dimensional data. We assign the database records into pages, predict the page index with the index models and then perform sequential search on the predicted page. In order to evaluate the errors that different index models are making, we focus on predicting the page indices and ignore the sequential search operation on a specific page. 

\begin{mscexample}
For example, assume we have an $1$-dimensional array $[1,2,3,4]$ and two pages such that $[1,2]\in P_0$ and $[3,4]\in P_1$. A point query for $x=2$ is expected to return 0 as the page index.

\subsubsection{Point Query with Lisa}
Point query search in LISA is composed of following steps.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find the cell to which point query belongs by comparing the query key value with first and last key in each cell. First key in the cell represents the lower corner of the cell, whereas last key in the cell represents the upper corner. This search will be linear in the number of grid cells.
	\item Calculate mapped value of the query key as mentioned in the section 'Mapping Function' \ref{sssec:Mapping_Function}
	\item During model training, 2 dimensional key space is mapped into a sorted one dimensional array. Find the mapped interval to which point query's mapped value belongs using binary search on this array.  
	\item Predict the shard Id for calculated mapped interval. It is found empirically that predicted shard Id can differ from ground-truth value by 1 for keys falling near the shard boundaries. 
	\item Search for the query key in the predicted shard by sequentially comparing against all the keys in the shard until a match is found. In case of no match, search in adjacent left and right shards as predicted shard Id can have an error of 1. 
\end{enumerate}
