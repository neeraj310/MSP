A range query is a database operation that retrieves all the records that lies in a range. In this project, we perform range query on $2$-dimensional data only. In addition, we only consider a range query where the range is defined as a rectangle. Under these assumptions, a range query can be formalised as a query $\mathcal{Q}(\boldsymbol{l}, \boldsymbol{u})$ where $l,u\in\mathbb{R}^2$ and $split\_axis$ as $\mathcal{S}$.

\begin{mscexample}
	For example, assume we have the points
	$$
	[(1,2), (3,4), (3.5, 4), (5,6)]
	$$
	and the range query $\mathcal{Q}((2,3), (5,5))$, as shown below:

   	\captionof{figure}{A Range Query Example where $\mathcal{Q}(\boldsymbol{l}, \boldsymbol{u})=\mathcal{Q}((2,3),(5,5))$}
	
In this example, the range query should return the points that lies inside the red rectangle, i.e. $((3,4), (3.5, 4))$.
