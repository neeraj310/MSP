$K$-Nearest Neighbours ($K$NN), as the name suggests, is the process of finding $K$ nearest neighbours to a given query point. In this project, $K$NN query is only performed on $2$-dimensional data. We use $\ell_2$ norm as the distance metric. A $K$NN query will be formalised as $\mathcal{K}(\boldsymbol{X})$ where $\boldsymbol{X}\in\mathbb{R}^2$.
