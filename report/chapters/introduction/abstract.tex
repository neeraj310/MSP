Databases use indexes to find records efficiently. Among these indexes, B-tree and KD-tree are two successful indexes used for 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional data. In this project, we first implement these two indexes from scratch. Then we implement the learned indexes, including a fully connected neural network and a recursive model for 1-dimensional data \cite{kraska2018case} and the LISA model for 2-dimensional data \cite{li2020lisa}. Afterwards, we conduct several experiments to evaluate the performance of learned indexes. In addition to the implementation and evaluation, we then theoretically analyse some properties that the learned indexes hold. Beyond that, we also explore and discuss the properties that the learned indexes should hold.

As an extension to the existing learned indexes, we explore the possibilities of using convolution operation and convolutional neural network as learned indexes.
