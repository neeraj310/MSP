In the following chapters, we will use the following terminologies

\textbf{Index model} is a function that maps the index of a row of data into the location (e.g. page index) of the data. For example, in one-dimensional case, the index models include B-Tree, Linear Regression models, etc.

\textbf{Key} is a special attribute in the database that could identify a record. In our work, the key could be a scalar in one-dimensional case, or a $(x,y)$ pair in two-dimensional case.

\textbf{Order of a tree} is the maximum number of children that a node can have.

\textbf{Internal node} is any node of a tree that has child nodes and is not a root node.

\textbf{Leaf node} is any node that does not have child nodes.

\textbf{Level} of a node is defined as the number of edges between this node and the root node.
